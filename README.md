This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

task details

React app:
Build a SPA using ReactJS which performs add, update, delete
functionality and listing of data.
Front End:
• Create an app using React JS with recent version which
supports hooks
• Back APIs can be REST or GraphQL. We prefer Graphql as
the API layer
• Use online APIs which fakes back end data
⁃ For Rest:
⁃ https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
⁃ https://gorest.co.in/
⁃ For GraphQL:
⁃ https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/
⁃ OR use any APIs of your choice
• Fields level validation must be implemented
• For List page, you can choose infinite scrolling (auto or on
button click) or page link based scrolling
⁃ The page filters of your choice it could be limit based or

cursor based
Code Versioning:
• Use git for code versioning
Hosting:
• We prefer if the code is hosted using netlify or code sandbox
• Sharing your git repo would suffice
Expectations:
• Usage of React Hooks, lazy loading, app and server data
state management in solution. You can use state
management library of your choice
• Error management in React
• Usage of React patterns
